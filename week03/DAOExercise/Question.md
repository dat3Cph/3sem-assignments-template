# Question for exercise:
### Explain the benefits of using DAO architecture for separating database access logic from business logic:
- The DAO pattern makes it easy to change the persistence mechanism as all changes are isolated to the DAO layer only.
- The DAO pattern emphasizes loose coupling between the application layers.
- The DAO pattern makes it easier to write unit tests for the application.
- The DAO pattern emphasizes the OOP principle of coding to an interface instead of an implementation.
